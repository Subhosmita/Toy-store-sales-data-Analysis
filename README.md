Toy Store Sales Data Analysis Project
Welcome to the Toy Store Sales Data Analysis project, a comprehensive data analytics initiative provided by Maven Analytics. This project focuses on analyzing sales data from a toy store, offering insights into the store's performance across various dimensions.

Project Overview
The objective of this project is to import, clean, model, and visualize toy store sales data, enabling data-driven decision-making. By transforming raw data into meaningful insights, we aim to identify key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends that can guide strategic business actions.

Process and Methodology
Data Import and Cleaning:
The initial phase involves importing the toy store sales data into Power Query. The data is then cleaned to ensure accuracy and consistency, addressing issues such as missing values, duplicates, and formatting errors.

Data Modeling:
Post cleaning, the data is modeled to establish relationships between different entities. This structured dataset forms the foundation for generating insightful analyses and reports.

Data Visualization:
The final phase focuses on visualizing the data using various charts and graphs. These visualizations are designed to highlight key metrics and trends, making it easier to understand and communicate the store's performance.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The following KPIs are created to measure and track the toy store's performance:

Total Orders: The total number of orders placed.
Total Profit: The overall profit generated.
Total Stores: The total number of stores contributing to the sales data.
Total Revenue: The cumulative revenue earned.
Visualizations
Several charts and graphs are developed to present the analyzed data:

Product Category by Orders: Displays the number of orders per product category.
Product Category by Profit: Shows the profit distribution across different product categories.
Product Category by Revenue: Illustrates the revenue generated by each product category.
Key Insights
Through this analysis, we uncover that a particular toy is the most profitable product, generating the highest revenue. This insight, along with others derived from the analysis, provides valuable information for strategic planning and decision-making.

In summary, the Toy Store Sales Data Analysis project leverages data analytics to transform raw sales data into actionable insights, guiding the toy store towards enhanced performance and profitability.
